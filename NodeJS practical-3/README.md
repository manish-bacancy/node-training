This practical is about to create differnt API's using nodeJS's HTTP core module and test all APIs in postman tool and fetch available jobs data.

Different APIs :
  Fetch all jobs data,
  Fetch single job data using jobID,
  Add new job data,
  Update already exists data in jobs.JSON file,
  Delete job data using jobID one at a time,
  
To performt this practical i have used fs, path and url module.
