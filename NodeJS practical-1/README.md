This practical is about to perform CRUD operation using NodeJS's File System core module.

Different Operations are : 
  Add new user in to local database,
  Fetch all users data,
  Fetch single user's data either using id or email,
  Update user's data either using id or email,
  Delete user's data either using id or email
  
 To perform this practical i have used NodeJS's fs, path and yargs module.
 Yargs module used to get parameter from the command line.
